            <section class="para1"><h1>ORIGIN OF LIFE</h1>
            <p >The origin of life started from the universes and the earth. According to the Big Bang 
                theory, the universe formed 13.8 billion's year ago, then the earth is formed about 4.5 
                billion's years ago. At the starting earth has no atmosphere, later some gases like 
                ammonia, carbon dioxide water vapour and so-on released from the hot surface and 
                slowly earth stated cooling, then water vapour condensed to form rain, and oceans 
                were created. Early scientists believed in ideas like Panspermia and spontaneous 
                generation, but these were rejected by later experiments. The Oparin-Haldane theory 
                suggested that life originated from non-living organic molecules in the atmosphere The 
                first non-cellular life appeared about 3 billion years ago, followed by simple cellular life 
                around 2 billion years ago, all living first in water. </p></section>
            <section class="para2"><h1 class="head">EVOLUTIONS OF LIFE FORMS</h1>
                <p >In earlier stages the people believe a theory that all species were created as they are 
                and never changed then, Charles Darwin observed that different organisms show 
                similarities to each other and to extinct species He concluded that life forms gradually 
                evolved over long periods through a process called natural selection. Organisms show 
                variations and reproduce more Over generations; new species arise from common 
                ancestors and then he changed the mind of the people by explaining the evolutions are 
                slow and occurs through the natural selection. </p></section>

                <img src="https://themuslimtimes.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/charles-darwin-tree-of-life-e1387177172113.jpg" alt="https://themuslimtimes.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/charles-darwin-tree-of-life-e1387177172113.jpg">
            <p >Biological evolutions started when living cells started to appear forms the core part of 
                the Darwin's theory of the evolutions, Microorganisms evolve very fast because they 
                reproduce quickly, whereas larger animals evolve slowly since their life span is long 
                Lamarck earlier proposed that organisms evolved by using or not using organs, but this 
                idea was rejected because acquired characters cannot be inherited. Evolution is 
                therefore understood as a gradual process driven by inherited variations. </p></section>
            <section class="para4" ><h1 class="head">MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION</h1>
                <img src="https://www.visiblebody.com/hubfs/learn/bio/assets/evolution/mechanisms-of-evolution.jpg" alt >
            <p >What is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even though Mendel 
                had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype, Darwin either ignored these 
                observations or kept silence. In the first decade of twentieth century, Hugo Devries 
                based on his work on evening primrose brought forth the idea of mutations-large 
                difference arising suddenly in a population. He believed that it is mutation which 
                causes evolution and not the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. 
                Mutations are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and 
                directional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while Devries believed mutation caused 
                speciation and hence called it saltation (single step large mutation). Studies in 
                population genetics, later, brought out some clarity. </p></section>
            <section class="para5"><h1 >HARDY-WEINBERG PRINCIPLE</h1>
                <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.uvLUAvthGD9_qO-PgYQBqQHaFj?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain&o=7&rm=3" alt >
            <p >The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that the allele frequencies in a large, randomly 
                mating population remain constant from generation to generation if no evolutionary 
                forces act on it. This stable condition is called genetic equilibrium. If the frequencies 
                deviate from expected mathematical values, evolution is taking place. The principle 
                uses the formula p² + 2pq + q² = 1 to represent the frequencies of different genotypes. 
                Factors such as mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, recombination and natural selection 
                disturb this equilibrium and cause evolutionary change.</p></section>
            <section class="para6"><h1>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF EVOLUTION </h1>
            <p >Life on earth began around 2000 million years ago with simple cells. Over time, single
                celled organisms gave rise to multicellular forms. About 500 million years ago, 
                invertebrates appeared, followed by jawless fish and then amphibians. Plants invaded 
                land before animals. Lobefin fish evolved into the first amphibians, which later gave rise 
                to reptiles. Reptiles dominated the earth for millions of years, including the dinosaurs. 
                Around 65 million years ago, dinosaurs disappeared due to unknown reasons. 
                Mammals, which were small earlier, began to dominate and diversified into many 
                forms, including those that returned to water like whales and dolphins. Evolution 
                continued through various geological periods, leading to the diversity we see today.</p></section>
            <section class="para7"><h1 class="head" >ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MAN </h1>
             <p> million years ago. Around 3-4 million years ago, Australopithecus lived in African 
                grasslands and walked upright. Later came Homo habilis, with a larger brain and the 
                ability to use tools. Homo erectus appeared about 1.5 million years ago and had a still 
                larger brain and ate meat. Neanderthal humans lived between 100,000 and 40,000 
                years ago and showed cultural behaviour like burying the dead. Modern humans, Homo 
                sapiens, arose in Africa between 75,000 and 10,000 years ago and spread across 
                continents. They developed language, tools, art and agriculture, which eventually led to 
                the rise of human civilizations.</p></section>
